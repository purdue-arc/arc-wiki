## Goal

<u>

### Mission

</u>

The mission of this project is to explore the perspective of robotics in replicating human-motion. A primary fascination in this is looking at tasks that might help us understand biomechanics, which is a more recent booming area of robotics. 

The goal of the project is to build a fully autonomous robot arm that can play the piano. The Human hand, with 27 degrees of freedom (DOF) has so far been the most dextrous mechanism to play the piano and the closer we get to replicating that degree of freedom and movement, the better it is to move the arm and play the piano.

This semester (Fall 2022), we are planning to refine our working model of the animatronic hand built last semester with the help of accurate servo motor and flex sensor functioning. We would expect to extend functioning to two hands as well. Additionally, we are starting a new path in software along image recognition by building a model that can read sheet music, given an image format.

Along the way, we will publish our progress, code, tutorials and workshops.

### What we have done

<u>

#### Fall 2021

</u>

Worked primarily on developing models and getting an idea of the different parts necessary to 3-D print. Produced the following first iteration of the hand by the end of the semester from hardware.

Software primarily worked on simulation and testing, and the following simulation was produced on TinkerCAD (TinkerCAD's electronic component simulator had Arduino testing capabilities and hence was useful for the first stage of testing)

#### Spring 2021

### Subteams

<u>

#### Hardware

</u>

Hardware primarily works on making and refining CAD models, 3D printing models, assembling and identifying points of improvement in the model and testing functionality.
